## Use notes

When searching albums avoid committing the next mistakes:

- Don't use symbols unless they are in the artist's name.

      For example:

      - Don't search Jack+Johnson
      - Instead search Jack Johnson

- Be careful not to write the exact artist's name.

      For example:

      - Don't search ArianaGrande, Bieber, BTTS or Beyonce
      - Instead search Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, BTS or Beyonc√©

- Search for the exact artist you are looking for.

      For example:

      - If you are searching for Lady Gaga, don't search only with Lady, because Lady is another artist.
